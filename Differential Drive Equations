##Differential Drive Equations

V_x         = Linear velocity of robot
w           = rotational/angular velocity of the robot 
V_r, V_l    = linear velicities of each wheel
v_r, v_l    = angular velocities of wheels (in rad/s)

v_r * R = V_r

V_x = R(v_r + v_l) / 2


#Same with the commented eq's w below taken from the one where R is used as ICC
#(Already proven in mind)
# w = (V_r - V_l) / 2d
w = R(v_r - v_l) / L        

v_r = (2V_x + w*L) / 2R
v_l = (2V_x - w*L) / 2R

V_r = V_x + w*L/2
V_l = V_x - w*L/2
